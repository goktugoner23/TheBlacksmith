# TheBlacksmith
This is a project that I started out of fun, and doing so I'm also learning tech that is new to me. Designed for personal use, maybe a group, not a whole discord server(s). That's why I didn't add any slash command limit or cooldown.
Th Blacksmith Discord Bot executes several tasks below with the help of other technologies like Selenium, Twitter4j and MongoDB. Uses several APIs according to the needs of the operation executed.
 
 1. Get characters according to user input of attributes from World of Warcraft Armory page, post the results to the channel as embed.
 2. Get a specific user's tweets or search for a query on Twitter and push them to a MongoDB. 
 3. Export the tweets as Excel and post a weTransfer link to DC Channel to download.
 4. Construct surveys to decide when to meet, which game to play, etc. (not added yet)
 5. Music play from YouTube. (not added yet)
 6. some other stuff I may add as ideas comes to mind
 7. Twitter real time monitoring(yet to be added)
 8. Added DALL-E support for image generation
 9. Added ChatGPT support - seems you need to have a paid plan to use the API though
